| 1          | Login users do not retain their balance when logged in and  log out | Currently, user account balances are not persisted between sessions. To address this, I plan to implement a backend database (DB) to store user account information securely. This will allow user balances to be retrieved and updated accurately, ensuring that their funds are maintained even after refreshing the page. By implementing a robust database solution, users' financial data will be stored securely and consistently, providing a seamless experience when using the platform. Additionally, this enhancement will pave the way for future features such as transaction history and portfolio tracking. |
